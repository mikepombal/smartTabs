smartTabs
=========



I started this plugin as an experimentation. It is a tabs control made as a jQuery plugin. It has already some nice features but there is so much more that can be done. Unfortunately I do not have much time for it as I am currently working in other projects. This is why I put the code to let the community carrying  on what has been done so far.


There is a demo page showing all the existing functionality ( http://localhost:7777/client/index.html once you have node running).
