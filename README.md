smartTabs
=========



I started this plugin as an experimentation, I wanted to build a control following the BDD way using Mocha and Chai.

This component is a tabs control systen made as a jQuery plugin. It has already some nice features but there is so much more that can be done. Unfortunately I do not have much time for it as I am currently working in other projects. This is why I put the code on here in case someone is interested in carrying on what has been done so far.


There is a demo page showing all the existing functionality at this following link http://localhost:7777/client/index.html once you have node running. To acceed the tests use this one http://localhost:7777/test/client/runner.html
